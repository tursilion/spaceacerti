How to Play
-----------

1) Move joystick
2) shoot stuff
3) don't die

There are thee ships you can choose from on the main game select. Each ship
has a gameplay quirk to it. Unless otherwise mentioned, all ships move at
a set speed, support all powerups, have a shield that makes you invincible
while slowly counting down, and give you four lives. Getting hit without a
shield will destroy a life and set you back slightly from the boss.

-Cruiser: Slowest ship, but has a continuous power shield that can take
three hits before vanishing, and can be recharged. You get one life.

-Snowball: Standard ship upon which all others are based.

-Ladybird: Smaller ship by popular demand. Shield counts down faster but
may be used offensively.

There are also three difficulty modes. Higher difficulty modes offer more
enemies, less shields, and better endings. ;)

Secrets
-------

The game has two secret ships and a third secret gameplay mode.

Background
----------

This game I originally started in 1989 for the TI.. a couple years later I 
rewrote it in "c99", a small C dialect for the TI-99/4A. I released this 
commercially in 1991 and sold a single copy (my distributor claimed to sell 
a dozen more.)

Anyway, I found the source code on an old disk, and ported it across to the 
Coleco. All I have to do was write the support functions. I was hiccupped 
slightly by a buggy rand() function (my fault), and poorly documented code, 
but it came up pretty quickly, and in general I'm tickled to play the game 
again on the Coleco.

Many, many things have changed now. New graphics, included boss graphics
from the Tyrian project, better behaviours, better power ups, multiple
ships with multiple game modes, and more yet to come!

As such, please do not redistribute this ROM, please do not burn it to carts. 
It's not finished yet. But please feel free to share links and keep it for 
yourself, and I hope you like it!
